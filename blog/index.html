You can find the first review here ES6 Review Part 1 Arrows I have been using arrow (-&gt;) and fat-arrow (=&gt;) key in Coffeescript for while, and I was happy when ES6 would support arrow key (=&gt;) as a short-hand of function keyword. Of course, if you’re familiar with arrow keys in Coffeescript, this feature will be similar.</p>

        <p>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is the upcoming version of ECMACScript standard which is supposed to be ready soon. There are number of significant changes in this new standard version of Javascript. So far I can tell, this is indeed the future of Javascript, and I love it. In this short blog, I use ES6 to demonstrate some new features of ES6 by writing the linked list data structure. Classes ES6 finally allows you to declare your object using class keyword.</p>

I guess this game has sticked with me for a very long time, so that today I decided to implement it again in my new favorite language - Ruby.</p>

Today I would love to share some of my favorite Vim Leaders that I found they&rsquo;re extremely helpful. You can add these into your .vimrc file, and give it a try. Open another file in same directory map &lt;Leader&gt;e :e &lt;C-R&gt;=escape(expand(&quot;%:p:h&quot;),' ') .

I&rsquo;ve seen people dancing their fingers on the keyboard using Vim, this made me wanted to try harder this time. Finally I totally switched to Vim as my main text editor. Here is the timeline that I setup my goal.</p>
