            <p>Today I just released menuOnScroll - jQuery plugin that automatically updates the menu
navigation when you scroll. This functionality is extremely common on the web,
especially for the single page website.
Since everyone just keeps build the similar thing over and over again, I think it&rsquo;s better to create a simple plugin that will help to save our time.</p>

<p>This plugin is the first open source (MIT) project that I&rsquo;ve done, and I am
super excited about this. Writing open source code really help me to write my
code cleaner because I kept refactoring my code over and over again in order to
make it not only easy to read but also to maintain. This is very important
factor that helps me to become a better developer.</p>

<p>I hope you will find this plugin useful in some way. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/pmkhoa/jquery-menuOnScroll">source
code</a> if you want to check it
out.</p>

<p>Cheers! Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

        <p>This is a second review post for new ES6 features that I&rsquo;d love to share. You can find the first review here ES6 Review Part 1 Arrows I have been using arrow (-&gt;) and fat-arrow (=&gt;) key in Coffeescript for while, and I was happy when ES6 would support arrow key (=&gt;) as a short-hand of function keyword. Of course, if youâ€™re familiar with arrow keys in Coffeescript, this feature will be similar.</p>

        <h3>ES6 Review Part 1</h3>
        <p>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is the upcoming version of ECMACScript standard which is supposed to be ready soon. There are number of significant changes in this new standard version of Javascript. So far I can tell, this is indeed the future of Javascript, and I love it. In this short blog, I use ES6 to demonstrate some new features of ES6 by writing the linked list data structure. Classes ES6 finally allows you to declare your object using class keyword.</p>

        <h3>How I switched to vim in 2 weeks</h3>
        <p>I have played with Vim so many times since I was in college, in fact that I loved it every time I used it. However, I don&rsquo;t think I ever spent time long enough to get used to it. I&rsquo;ve seen people dancing their fingers on the keyboard using Vim, this made me wanted to try harder this time. Finally I totally switched to Vim as my main text editor. Here is the timeline that I setup my goal.</p>

        <h3>Create App With Meteor</h3>
        <p><p>When I started to build the DearJJAbrams.com site, I came across a very simple functionality which was the realtime counter. This realtime counter worked as follow, when the user submitted their email, the counter would increase 1. However, this counter had to automatically update and synchronize with the server whenever anyone around the world submit their email, in other words, I had to create real time app with Meteor.</p>
