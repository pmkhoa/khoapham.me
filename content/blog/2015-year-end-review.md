It was a great year of works, and an exciting year of life.

### **Works**
#### 1. Leaving the agency world
I worked for great creative agencies such as Sincerely Truman, and The Program
in Portland, Oregon for over 3 years. It was tough to leave the agency working
environment style to join the team at Network Redux and worked on a startup project called Seastar. 
Working with creative agencies gave me lot of opportunities to explore new technologies, and ideas, it always excited me when trying something new. However, I always found myself in the contradict position that I not only wanted to try new technologies, but also wanted to master the one that I really cared and loved. For instance, here are the list of things that worked with in the agency world.

- Javascript: BackboneJS, EmberJS, MeteorJS, NodeJS, ReactJS.
- Back-end: PHP, Ruby, Javascript.
- Frameworks: Rails, Wordpress, Meteor, Yii, Shopify, Squarespace, Facebook App,
    Twitter App.
- Database: MongoDB, Mysql, Postgresql.
- Lot of other libraries, and third-party applications.


I was at a point where I no longer wanted to scratch the surface of them, but focusing on several on that would shape my career in the future. That was when I made my best decision to join the Seastar team.

#### 2. Entering the start-up world
[Start-up is
tough](http://startupljackson.com/post/135800367395/how-to-get-rich-in-tech-guaranteed?). I basically live and breath with it.

Differently from what I worked in several previous, now I can focus on some technologies that I love such as EmberJS, Golang, Cassandra, and hopefully Swift too.

My role is in charged frontend developer, focusing on UX, and product brand and design. The challenging part of UX is that I have to understand users usage, and behevior by putting myself in user perspective for our products. I am very lucky to be a part of the Seastar team. Everyone is amazing, and I have learned so much when working with them. The experience is just priceless.

#### 3. Accomplishments

- Launched: Classfare, Ratio Coffee, My OneSight, Seastar.io, OMSI Zoo in You. 
- Switched code editor from Sublime to Vim.
- Switched personal blog from Middleman to Hugo.

### **Life**
- I'm grateful that my works allow me to work remotely any days in the week, this
helped me a lot with my work life balance.
- My 2 years old has kept me busy through the year. She started to talk more, and
asked more questions. Sometimes it was hard to answer all of her questions.
- The 4 days vacation in Disneyland was precious family time.
- Multiple day trips to Cannon beach were really great, especially when we
    brought small tent with us so we could take nap in it.
- The Apple Watch motivated me to exercise more regularly.
