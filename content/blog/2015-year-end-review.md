### **Works**
#### 1. Leaving the agency world
In the past few years, I worked for great creative agencies such as [Sincerely Truman](http://sincerelytruman.com), and [The Program](http://theprogrampdx.com)
in Portland, Oregon, it was tough to leave the agency working
environment. Working with creative agencies gave me lot of opportunities to explore new technologies, and ideas. It always excited me when trying something new. However, I always found myself in the conflict position that I not only wanted to try new technologies, but also wanted to deepen my knowledge for the one that I loved and cared about. For instance, here are the list of things that worked with:

- Back-end: PHP, Ruby, Javascript.
- Javascript: BackboneJS, EmberJS, MeteorJS, NodeJS, ReactJS.
- Frameworks: Rails, Wordpress, Meteor, Yii, Shopify, Squarespace, Facebook App,
    Twitter App.
- Database: MongoDB, Mysql, Postgresql.
- Lot of other libraries, and third-party applications.

I was at a point where I no longer wanted to scratch the surface of them, but focusing on several on that would shape my career in the future. That was when I made my best decision to join the [Seastar team](http://www.seastar.io/team/).

#### 2. Entering the start-up world
[Start-up is
tough](http://startupljackson.com/post/135800367395/how-to-get-rich-in-tech-guaranteed?). I basically have to live and breath with it.

Differently from what I worked in several previous, now I can focus on some technologies that I love such as EmberJS, Golang, Cassandra, and hopefully Swift too.

My role is in charged for the front-end of product focusing on UX, and product brand and design. I am very lucky to be a part of the Seastar team. Everyone is amazing, and I have learned so much when working with them. The experience is just priceless.

### **Life**
- I'm grateful that my works allow me to work remotely any days in the week, this
helped me a lot for my work-life balance.
- My 2 years old has kept me busy through the year. She started to talk more, and
asked more questions. Sometimes it was hard to answer all of her questions.
- The 4 days vacation in Disneyland was precious family time.
- One Seattle trip to visit friend.
- Multiple day trips to Cannon beach were really great, especially when we
    brought small tent with us so we could take nap in it.
