The new year 2019 is just hours away, I decide to take some moment to reflect
myself for the last year. 2018 was full of changes and challenges for both family
and work. 

# The Good

## Family
The whole family went through unexpected events very bravely together. This
has helped us to love, grow and understand the important of family. I couldn't
thank enough for my wife devoting herself to give our best to our children.
She's always patient, gentle and thoughtful. My daughter started kindergarten in
2018, we were so nervous when taking her to school the first day. It turned out
parents seem to easily overreact things comparing to children, Sophia coped very
well with school. She made new friends, learnt ton of new things. It has been
only 4 months, but she could read some children books by herself and draw and
make up stories. My son is indeed a mommy boy. For his first day at pre-school,
he cried almost the whole time. It took him for a month to stop crying. He's
bright, and can learn things very quickly. It's rare to see my my kids sharing
and playing together, but when they do, it's such a blessing! My parents-in-law
have always been willing to help us when we need, I'm so thankful for that. My parents are still living in Vietnam. I miss them very much and wish I can spend more time with them. 


## Work
There are lot of opportunities and challenges at work. I left Cambia
(Healthsparq) for over a year working there. I realized that I love working in a
fast pace start-up environment instead. Which is lead me to join Nike Valiant
Labs, a hub spot for building startups at Nike. It's been really fun to meet new
people and working on a excited projects. I join the team as a <b>Senior Application
Engineering</b> with more focus on the UX, and UI side.
I also had great time working with new technologies such as: GraphQL,
Serverless, AWS Lamda, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Server side rendering with React,
Styled Components, Node and Express...

#### Joyn.co
My first project at the Nike is to help leading the front-end team to build the user experience for
Joyn.co (https://joyn.co), a community fitness that help instructors can easily setup
their classes and let students sign up through the platform easily. We developed
the application for 4 months and launched the beta and then pilot in 8 months.
Unfortunately, we had to pivot into different direction and decided to shutdown
Joyn for 8 months running it, but we've learnt so much from it. For now we're
keeping an eye on the online content based for fitness. 

#### Resku
The other project that I'm helping now is Resku (https://resku.co). We're selling a more affordable
Nike shoes (from returned or cosmetically flawed shoes.) This has been gaining
great traction from the market, and I'm excited for its future.


## Side Projects
The work at Nike always kept me busy, but to stay fresh I also enjoyed on
working on side projects with friends and helping local non-profit businesses to
accomplish their mission.

#### Last Heavy
Working with the two awesome creative directors in Portland, OR to build an
unconventional and incredible website for the Last Heavy (https://lastheavy.com)
brand. We spent endless amount of time to think creatively and fine-tuning the
experience. I ‚ù§ this site so much.

#### Non Profit Projects
Since my daughter and my son joined co-op preschool at
Oswego Playschool (https://www.oswegoplayschool.com/), I feel really passionate
with helping non-profit organization to rebrand, develop and rebuild their
websites. Here are some of it:

- Oswego Playschool: https://www.oswegoplayschool.com/
- Language Skill Therapy: https://www.languageskillstherapy.org/
- Language and Literacy Fund: https://www.languageandliteracyfund.org/

# The Bad

## Personal
- I usually cook and eat most of health food for the family; however, I didn't
really take care of myself as much as I wanted. I didn't do much exercise or
meditation during the year. 
- I also keep thinking about changing from night owl to morning person, I blame
    it for the busy schedule and side projects.
- I started the investment, but it's so hard to keep emotion from making
    mistake. I shouldn't let emotion takes control when doing investment.
- I wasn't very good at letting personal belongings go which I end up collect so
    many stuffs.

## Work
- Got several ideas to work on personal side projects, but I didn't really have
    time or find motivation to work on them.
- I didn't achieve my goal to learn more about database and containers.
- I didn't do much pair programming with other team members.
- I didn't finish books that i bought.
- I wasn't very good at writing retrospective notes after finishing projects.
- I didn't contribute to open source projects.

# The Improvement
There are several things that I need to improve in this year.

- Start running.
- Meditation for 30 minutes a day: 15 minutes morning and 15 minutes before bed.
- Go to sleep early and wake up early. Set goal for 10:00 to sleep.
- Start minimalism by decluttering things that not bringing any value or
    happiness to our life.
- Start saving more (recession, I'm looking at you).
- Hike more.
- Read more books.
- Get to know more with people at work, should spend more time at lunch time.
- Need to think of investment as long term.
- Start contributing to favorite open source projects and between the team.
- Suggesting pair programming at work with other team.
- Write notes after finishing projects.
- Technologies to invest in 2019: React, NodeJS, Go, Docker,
    Kubernetes, Serverless, and Postgres.
