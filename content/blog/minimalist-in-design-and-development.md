My website has gone through countless design iterations, not because its look
was outdated, but my sense of simplicity has changed from time to time, and I
wanted my personal website to reflect that.

Unlike previous versions in which I wanted to prove my dev skills by developing a
fairly complicated website with lot of technologies under the hood, this time I rebuilt the website with a single purpose "minimalist in design and development".

As a result, my website now becomes much more simpler, and requires only 6 - 8
requests (total ~200KB) per page load in less than a second. Moreover, I wrote
zero Javascript code in this website even though I usually write about 50,000 lines of
javascript a year. 

This doesn't mean that writing less code is better, but this is a process that I will start to do from now "Just write the code that matters".
