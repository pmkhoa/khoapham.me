title: Webpack Starter - Use ES6 Today
tags: [Webpack, Javascript, ES6]
---

Back in early 2015, when I started [writing Javascript in ES6](/blog/es6-review-part-1); it was not easy to get everything running smoothly at that time. Today some developers still not sure where to get started using ES6 even though it's widely adopted by Javascript community. I spent an evening writing a simple [Webpack Boilerplate](https://github.com/pmkhoa/webpack-start) to help new developers to use it for their new project easily.

What does this [minimalist boilerplate](https://github.com/pmkhoa/webpack-start) includes?

- Webpack core
- Webpack dev server
- Webpack module loader
- SASS compiler
- ES6 (using Babel)
- Livereload
- Production build ready
- Example code for loading modules & scss

This is, hopefully, enough for ES6 newcomers can give it a try for their
projects.

Happy coding & happy sharing.
