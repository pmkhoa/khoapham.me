&lt;p&gt;Meta tags are important because they help search engine to crawl your website properly, and make your website display correctly when sharing on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. This is why I created a simple tool to generate these standard meta tags &amp;amp; social tags.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://d3js.org/&#34;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt; is a great javascript library for creating data visualization chart. I have
been a big fan of it for over a year now. However, whenever I need to develop a
quick chart prototype, I use an alternative library called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/examples/&#34;&gt;Rickshaw&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s an
extension from D3, so you can get greatness from both of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had a chance to have my hand on setting up a web server using Nginx
and Centos. The requirements were simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server can serve multiple domains or subdomains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each domain web folder is stored under different user account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
