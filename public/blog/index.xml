      <title>Full Stack Development with Ember and Golang</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my personal 2016 resolution was learning Go, and get familiar with
writing restful API using Go. After couple of months learning Go, I started a
simple application that use Go, and Ember to develop a Todo app.

Yes, you read it right, I&amp;rsquo;m also creating another Todo app. Yet this one is different from the
other you have seen because it&amp;rsquo;s built with Go for backend api, and Ember for
frontend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Webpack Starter - Use ES6 Today</title>
      <link>http://khoapham.me/blog/webpack-starter/</link>

      <description>Back in early 2015, when I started writing Javascript in ES6; it was not easy to get everything running smoothly at that time. Today some developers are still not sure where to get started using ES6 even though it&amp;rsquo;s widely adopted by Javascript community. I spent an evening writing a simple Webpack Boilerplate to help new developers to use it for their new projects.
What does this minimalist boilerplate include?</description>

      <title>Deploy Ember App on Github Pages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Github pages is ideal for hosting static websites. Especially if you&amp;rsquo;re developing a open source project, and want to have a simple website for it.

      <title>Meta Tags Generator</title>

&lt;p&gt;Meta tags are important because they help search engine to crawl your website properly, and make your website display correctly when sharing on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. This is why I created a simple tool to generate these standard meta tags &amp;amp; social tags.

      <title>Global Notification Using Ember Initializer and Service</title>

      <guid>http://khoapham.me/blog/global-notification-using-ember-initializer-and-service/</guid>
      <description>When developing Ember app, you may want to have a singleton to handle global state such as global notification, or error handling. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t fall into Route, Controller, or Component. Ember offers an easy way to manage this using Service and Initializers.
Create a service to hold notification data //app/services/global-notification.js import Ember from &#39;ember&#39;; export default Ember.Service.extend({ notification: null, init() { this.set(&#39;notification&#39;, null); } });  Create an initializer to inject global notification service in application This allows us to use GlobalNotification service in route, and component.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://d3js.org/&#34;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt; is a great javascript library for creating data visualization chart. I have
been a big fan of it for over a year now. However, whenever I need to develop a
quick chart prototype, I use an alternative library called
&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/examples/&#34;&gt;Rickshaw&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s an
extension from D3, so you can get greatness from both of them.

      <description>When I started to get back to blogging, I felt my website took a little long to compile. As a revolution of redesigning my blog, I want to switch my blog platform to something faster. My blog was previously developed using Middleman, and now it&amp;rsquo;s powered by Hugo, a faster static site generator. I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with the transition so far.
I also wrote a simple Hugo theme called Hugo Minimalist, this is just a mimic of my current blog style, which I explained in Minimalist in design.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My website has gone through countless design iterations, not because its look
was outdated, but my sense of simplicity has changed from time to time, and I
wanted my personal website to reflect that.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had a chance to have my hand on setting up a web server using Nginx
and Centos. The requirements were simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server can serve multiple domains or subdomains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each domain web folder is stored under different user account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>This is a second review post for new ES6 features that I&amp;rsquo;d love to share. You can find the first review here ES6 Review Part 1
Arrows I have been using arrow (-&amp;gt;) and fat-arrow (=&amp;gt;) key in Coffeescript for while, and I was happy when ES6 would support arrow key (=&amp;gt;) as a short-hand of function keyword. Of course, if youâ€™re familiar with arrow keys in Coffeescript, this feature will be similar.</description>

      <description>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is the upcoming version of ECMACScript standard which is supposed to be ready soon. There are number of significant changes in this new standard version of Javascript. So far I can tell, this is indeed the future of Javascript, and I love it.
In this short blog, I use ES6 to demonstrate some new features of ES6 by writing the linked list data structure.
 Classes ES6 finally allows you to declare your object using class keyword.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite childhood game was the Tower of Hanoi which I loved playing it with my neighbor friends all the time. Also, one of my very first project in college was implementing the tower of Hanoi in C, C++, or Java. I guess this game has stuck with me for a very long time, so that today I decided to implement it again in my new favorite language - Ruby.</description>

      <title>MenuOnScroll - jQuery Plugin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I just released menuOnScroll - jQuery plugin that automatically updates the menu
navigation when you scroll. This functionality is extremely common on the web,
especially for the single page website. 
Since everyone just keeps build the similar thing over and over again, I think it&amp;rsquo;s better to create a simple plugin that will help to save our time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed using Vim for a month now, and I have to admit that I
love the feeling of learning new things from Vim everyday. Today I would love to
share some of my favorite Vim Leaders that I found they&amp;rsquo;re extremely helpful. You
can add these into your .vimrc file, and give it a try.

      <description>I have played with Vim so many times since I was in college, in fact that I loved it every time I used it. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever spent time long enough to get used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people dancing their fingers on the keyboard using Vim, this made me wanted to try harder this time. Finally I totally switched to Vim as my main text editor.</description>

      <title>Create App With Meteor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started to build the DearJJAbrams.com site, I came across a very simple functionality which was the realtime counter. This realtime counter worked as follow, when the user submitted their email, the counter would increase 1. However, this counter had to automatically update and synchronize with the server whenever anyone around the world submit their email, in other words, I had to create real time app with Meteor.

At this point, things were getting little more complicated. The big question was how could the browser know when the database was updated in order to get synchronized? But, I was lucky to found out that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meteor.com&#34;&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; was a perfect tool for this simple counter app.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Recently when developing a site using middleman, my client wonder that if we can do localization for the website. Fortunately, Middleman comes with the localization extension i18n which is pretty simple to integrate it into the site. Although there&amp;rsquo;s a quick overview of Middleman Localization available on the middlemanapp.com, I still find it a little bit confused for Middleman beginners. Here are quick steps how to set it up:
1. Activate i18n and update your bundle.</description>
