People asked me why I had a computer science degree but spending most of my time working as user experience developer.
Here is the article that hooked me into it: <!--more-->[https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see](https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see). 
It has changed the way I saw thing since I read it. I highly recommend you read it too.

Sincerely,
