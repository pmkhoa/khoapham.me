      <description>When I started to get back to blogging, I felt my website took a little long to compile. As a revolution of redesigning my blog, I want to switch my blog platform to something faster. My blog was previously developed using Middleman, and now it&amp;rsquo;s powered by Hugo, a faster static site generator. I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with the transition so far.
I also wrote a simple Hugo theme called Hugo Minimalist, this is just a mimic of my current blog style, which I explained in Minimalist in design.</description>

      <description>People asked me why I had a computer science degree but spending most of my time working as user experience developer. Here is the article that hooked me into it: https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see. It has changed the way I saw thing since I read it. I highly recommend you read it too.
Sincerely,
Khoa</description>
