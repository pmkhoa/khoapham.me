&lt;p&gt;Meta tags are important because they help search engine to crawl your website properly, and make your website display correctly when sharing on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. This is why I created a simple tool to generate these standard meta tags &amp;amp; social tags.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was struck with a simple story about working with great attitude would have a
great impact on the outcome of the work.

      <title>My First Hugo Theme</title>
      <link>http://khoapham.me/blog/first-hugo-theme/</link>

      <description>When I started to get back to blogging, I felt my website took a little long to compile. As a revolution of redesigning my blog, I want to switch my blog platform to something faster. My blog was previously developed using Middleman, and now it&amp;rsquo;s powered by Hugo, a faster static site generator. I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with the transition so far.
I also wrote a simple Hugo theme called Hugo Minimalist, this is just a mimic of my current blog style, which I explained in Minimalist in design.</description>

      <title>Minimalist in Design and Development</title>
      <link>http://khoapham.me/blog/minimalist-in-design-and-development/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My website has gone through countless design iterations, not because its look
was outdated, but my sense of simplicity has changed from time to time, and I
wanted my personal website to reflect that.

      <title>How I switched to vim in 2 weeks</title>
      <link>http://khoapham.me/blog/how-i-switched-to-vim-in-2-weeks/</link>

      <description>I have played with Vim so many times since I was in college, in fact that I loved it every time I used it. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever spent time long enough to get used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people dancing their fingers on the keyboard using Vim, this made me wanted to try harder this time. Finally I totally switched to Vim as my main text editor.</description>

      <description>People asked me why I had a computer science degree but spending most of my time working as user experience developer. Here is the article that hooked me into it: https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see. It has changed the way I saw thing since I read it. I highly recommend you read it too.
Sincerely,

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my favority poem, &amp;ldquo;If - Rudyard Kipling&amp;rdquo; is definitely the one.&lt;br /&gt;
It simply reminds me how to be a man, and a good person.
