      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed using Vim for a month now, and I have to admit that I
love the feeling of learning new things from Vim everyday. Today I would love to
share some of my favorite Vim Leaders that I found they&amp;rsquo;re extremely helpful. You
can add these into your .vimrc file, and give it a try.

      <description>I have played with Vim so many times since I was in college, in fact that I loved it every time I used it. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever spent time long enough to get used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people dancing their fingers on the keyboard using Vim, this made me wanted to try harder this time. Finally I totally switched to Vim as my main text editor.</description>
