                <title>My First Hugo Theme</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started to get back to blogging, I felt my website
took a little long to compile. As a revolution of redesigning my blog, I want to switch my blog platform to something faster. 
My blog was previously developed using &lt;a href=&#34;http://middlemanapp.com&#34;&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;, and now it&amp;rsquo;s powered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a faster static site
generator. I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased with the transition so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a simple Hugo theme called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pmkhoa/hugo-minimalist&#34;&gt;Hugo
Minimalist&lt;/a&gt;, this is just a mimic of
my current blog style, which I explained in &lt;a href=&#34;http://khoapham.me/blog/minimalist-in-design-and-development/&#34;&gt;Minimalist in
design&lt;/a&gt;. Of
course, it&amp;rsquo;s free to use if you want to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share is the better workflow for my website
deployment. With Middleman, I host the website on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&#34;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt;, use Markdown to write content, and use
Middleman extension
&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/sync-middleman-with-amazon-s3/&#34;&gt;s3_deployment&lt;/a&gt; to deploy to S3, and then commit to github.
The whole process wasn&amp;rsquo;t taking too long, but it can be simplified.
With Hugo, the website is hosted on Github (free), and I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pmkhoa/khoapham.me/blob/master/deploy.sh&#34;&gt;simple script&lt;/a&gt; to deploy and commit to github just one command when the
content is ready for production. I think the whole process is just better now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plan to write lot of blog posts, and want to use static site generator
for it, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;My website has gone through countless design iterations, not because its look
was outdated, but my sense of simplicity has changed from time to time, and I
wanted my personal website to reflect that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous versions in which I wanted to prove my dev skills by developing a
fairly complicated website with lot of technologies under the hood, this time I rebuilt the website with a single purpose &amp;ldquo;minimalist in design and development&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, my website now becomes much more simpler, and requires only 6 - 8
requests (total ~200KB) per page load in less than a second. Moreover, I wrote
zero Javascript code in this website even though I usually write about 50,000 lines of
javascript a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that writing less code is better, but this is a process that I will start to do from now &amp;ldquo;Just write the code that matters&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;People asked me why I had a computer science degree but spending most of my time working as user experience developer.
Here is the article that hooked me into it: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see&#34;&gt;https://ia.net/know-how/learning-to-see&lt;/a&gt;.
It has changed the way I saw thing since I read it. I highly recommend you read it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
