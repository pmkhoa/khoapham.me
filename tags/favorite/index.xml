                <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my favority poem, &amp;ldquo;If - Rudyard Kipling&amp;rdquo; is definitely the one.&lt;br /&gt;
It simply reminds me how to be a man, and a good person.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;if&#34;&gt;If&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can keep your head when all about you&lt;br /&gt;
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,&lt;br /&gt;
But make allowance for their doubting too:&lt;br /&gt;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,&lt;br /&gt;
Or, being lied about, don&amp;rsquo;t deal in lies,&lt;br /&gt;
Or being hated don&amp;rsquo;t give way to hating,&lt;br /&gt;
And yet don&amp;rsquo;t look too good, nor talk too wise;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,&lt;br /&gt;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster&lt;br /&gt;
And treat those two impostors just the same:&lt;br /&gt;
If you can bear to hear the truth you&amp;rsquo;ve spoken&lt;br /&gt;
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,&lt;br /&gt;
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,&lt;br /&gt;
And stoop and build&amp;rsquo;em up with worn-out tools;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can make one heap of all your winnings&lt;br /&gt;
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,&lt;br /&gt;
And lose, and start again at your beginnings,&lt;br /&gt;
And never breathe a word about your loss:&lt;br /&gt;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew&lt;br /&gt;
To serve your turn long after they are gone,&lt;br /&gt;
And so hold on when there is nothing in you&lt;br /&gt;
Except the Will which says to them: &amp;ldquo;Hold on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,&lt;br /&gt;
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,&lt;br /&gt;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,&lt;br /&gt;
If all men count with you, but none too much:&lt;br /&gt;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute&lt;br /&gt;
With sixty seconds&amp;rsquo; worth of distance run,&lt;br /&gt;
Yours is the Earth and everything that&amp;rsquo;s in it,&lt;br /&gt;
And—which is more—you&amp;rsquo;ll be a Man, my son!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rudyard Kipling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
