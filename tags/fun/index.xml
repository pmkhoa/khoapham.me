      <description>One of my favorite childhood game was the Tower of Hanoi which I loved playing it with my neighbor friends all the time. Also, one of my very first project in college was implementing the tower of Hanoi in C, C++, or Java. I guess this game has stuck with me for a very long time, so that today I decided to implement it again in my new favorite language - Ruby.</description>
