                <description>&lt;p&gt;My website has gone through countless design iterations, not because its look
was outdated, but my sense of simplicity has changed from time to time, and I
wanted my personal website to reflect that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous versions in which I wanted to prove my dev skills by developing a
fairly complicated website with lot of technologies under the hood, this time I rebuilt the website with a single purpose &amp;ldquo;minimalist in design and development&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, my website now becomes much more simpler, and requires only 6 - 8
requests (total ~200KB) per page load in less than a second. Moreover, I wrote
zero Javascript code in this website even though I usually write about 50,000 lines of
javascript a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that writing less code is better, but this is a process that I will start to do from now &amp;ldquo;Just write the code that matters&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
